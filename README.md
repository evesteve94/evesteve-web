Welcome to the repo for **evesteve web** ‚Äì a personal project currently under construction.  
This site is part testbed, part passion project, and hopefully the foundation of a real business in the near future.

## About

**evesteve web** is a handcrafted website project aimed at helping small businesses get beautiful, fast, and functional web presences without the usual headaches. While still in development, the vision is to offer custom-built websites with a personal touch ‚Äî no templates, no fluff.

The name comes from a mix of my name (Eva) and my four-legged coding companion, Stevie üê∂ ‚Äì my best friend and best colleague.

## Project Status üöß

This is a **work in progress** and a space for me to experiment, learn, and build out the kind of services I'd one day love to offer full-time.  
While it's not yet deployed live, that's the goal ‚Äî to grow this into something real.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **React** with TypeScript
- **React Router** for routing
- **CSS Modules** for styling
- **FontAwesome** for icons
- **Figma** for all custom UI elements and branding (including logo and illustrations)
- **Headless CMS (planned integration)**

## Features (Current & Planned)

- Fully responsive layout
- Custom illustrations and logos made in Figma
- Floating text layout with images
- Mobile-friendly navigation with smooth dropdown transitions
- Modular and scalable component structure
- Planned support for headless CMS (like Sanity or Contentful)
- SEO basics and Google Analytics 4 integration (in progress)
